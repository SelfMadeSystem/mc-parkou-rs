# MC Parkou.rs

## What is this?

A standalone parkour server for Minecraft 1.20.1. It is based off of the
`parkour` example from the [Valence](https://valence.rs) project.

## Why?

I wanted to learn Rust and I also wanted to make a parkour generator for
Minecraft. This is the result.

## How do I run it?

1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `cargo run --release`

## How do I play?

1. Run the server
2. Connect to `localhost:25565` with a Minecraft 1.20.1 client
